	"description": "This dataset contains threads containing short user posts on debate topics across multiple online forums. The well-studied forums are 4Forums.com (on average 340 users per topic and 19 posts per user) and CreateDebate.org (310 users per topic and 4 posts per user). The key task is classifying the usersâ€™ stances towards discussion topics and classifying the polarity of replies between users. 4Forums.com has crowd-sourced annotations with high inter-annotator agreement for stances of users in each topic and dis/agreement between users that reply to one another. CreateDebate.org supports self-labeling for stance and dis/agreement, but for each post authored by a user.",
