    "description": "This dataset contains interactions between drugs and targets collected from DrugBank, KEGG Drug, DCDB, and Matador. It was originally collected by <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cmb.2010.0213\">Perlman et al</a>. It contains 315 drugs, 250 targets, 1,306 drug-target interactions, 5 types of drug-drug similarities, and 3 types of target-target similarities. Drug-drug similarities include Chemical-based, Ligand-based, Expression-based, Side-effect-based, and Annotation-based similarities. Target-target similarities include Sequence-based, Protein-protein interaction network-based, and Gene Ontology-based similarities. The original task on the dataset is to predict new interactions between drugs and targets based on different types of similarities in the network.",
