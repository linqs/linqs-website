Each user has 4 features and is manually labeled as \"spammer\" or \"not spammer\". Each link represents an action between two users and includes a timestamp and a type. The network contains 7 anonymized types of links. The original task on the dataset is to identify (i.e., classify) the spammer users based on their relational and non-relational features.",
