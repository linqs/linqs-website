    "research": "My research interests are at the intersection of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and scalability. This includes making SRL faster through improvements to grounding, optimization, databases, out-of-core algorithms, and just better software development. I am also interested in creating tools that make SRL more accessible to all those in need of machine learning. SRL has been shown to provide more accurate predictions with less data, I consider it my job to provide the tools and knowledge to prove this to all machine learners.",
