    "abstract": "Mood and activity logging applications empower users to monitor their daily well-being and make informed health choices. To provide users with useful feedback that can improve quality of life, a critical task is understanding the causal effects of daily activities on mood and other wellness markers. In this work, we analyze observational data from EmotiCal, a recently developed mood-logging web application, to explore the effects of exercise on mood. We investigate several methodological choices for estimating the conditional average treatment effect, and highlight a novel use of textual data to improve the significance of our results.",
