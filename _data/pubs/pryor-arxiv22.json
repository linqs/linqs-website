  "abstract": "We present Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), a novel neuro-symbolic (NeSy) framework that unites state-of-the-art symbolic reasoning with the low-level perception of deep neural networks. To explicitly model the boundary between neural and symbolic representations, we introduce NeSy Energy-Based Models, a general family of energy-based models that combine neural and symbolic reasoning. Using this framework, we show how to seamlessly integrate neural and symbolic parameter learning and inference. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation and show that NeuPSL outperforms existing methods on joint inference and has significantly lower variance in almost all settings.",
